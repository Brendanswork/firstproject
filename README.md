<! -- This first project began as an interest to learn more about HTML/CSS/Javascript via the Bootstrap themes available.
I decided to take a Resume template and alter the contents to reflect my current resume in order to 'learn by doing'. 

I plan on making more changes as I learn about responsive web development and bootstrap -->

<! -- All credit goes to https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume for this template and source code. -->
